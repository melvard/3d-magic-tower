# GameDescription -- 3d-magic-tower 
This is a non-fully accomplished mobile game designed in Unity Engine. This casual game demands from player to create a tower based with the brick in the 3d environment.

If the brick is placed on the tower not perfecttly the outer part of the "cake-brick" will be sliced and droped down and consequently the size of next brick will be less than the previous one's. 

The player gets scrores for every successful brick placment. Game ends if player can't place the brick (at least a small part) on the tower.
